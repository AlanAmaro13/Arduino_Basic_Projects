# Introduction to Arduino One with Basic Projects

Welcome back! In this repository you will find a series of basic projects developed in Arduino One (ARD). All of this projects implement the Arduino IDE (1.8) and a series of basic components, such as LEDs, resistors, push bottons, motors, etc. In each folder you will find the main code or Skech along with the used components. 

Index: 
* [Incredible car](https://github.com/AlanAmaro13/Arduino_Basic_Projects/blob/main/Auto_Increible.ino): Turn on and off five LEDs sequentially.
* [Countdown](https://github.com/AlanAmaro13/Arduino_Basic_Projects/blob/main/Countdown_9_Segments_Display.ino) Arduino One does a contdown using a 9 segments display.
* [Botton State Detection](https://github.com/AlanAmaro13/Arduino_Basic_Projects/blob/main/Botton_State_Detection.ino) This code does a state detection when a button is pushed.
